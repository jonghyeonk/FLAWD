# Project Name: FLAWD

## General info
A formal language, FLAWD, that can characterise process-data quality problems, specifically those captured by the event log data imperfection patterns, and a software tool that supports this language and through which errors can be injected into event logs in a controlled way. FLAWD addresses the issue of unavailability of labelled real world event logs for developing and evaluating event log quality management and repairing techniques.
