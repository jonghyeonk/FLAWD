# How to run the scalability test

Firstly, change your current directory into a purposed folder (e.g., BPIC17). Then, run "python test_inadvertenttimetravel.py --log b17 --rate 0.05".
This implementation will provide an output file "summary_InadvertentTimeTravel.csv" which is used for tables/figures in our paper.
